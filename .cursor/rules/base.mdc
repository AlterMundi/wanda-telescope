# WANDA Telescope - Base Rules (Always Applied)

## Platform Usage
- This file is for Cursor users only. Cursor will always apply `base.mdc` and you can enable additional rule files from `.cursor/rules/` as needed.
- Claude Code users should NOT load `.cursor/rules/*`. Use the repository-level `CLAUDE.md` instead, which mirrors these rules for Claude.

## Project Context
WANDA (World-wide Area Network for Distributed Astronomy) is a full-stack astrophotography system for Raspberry Pi featuring a **Next.js 14 frontend** with **React 19** and a **Python Flask backend** with **Socket.IO**. It provides a comprehensive solution for controlling camera and equatorial mount systems for celestial object tracking, with real-time WebSocket updates and production-ready deployment via Nginx reverse proxy.

## Core Architecture Requirements
- **Factory Pattern**: Use factories for camera and mount hardware detection
- **Abstract Base Classes**: Define interfaces through ABC for all hardware components
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Always provide mock implementations for development
- **Thread Safety**: Ensure all hardware operations are thread-safe

## Mandatory Development Practices

### Run virtual environment:
- **source venv/bin/activate** 

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **ALWAYS write tests first** before implementing any feature
- **Minimum 85% code coverage** for all new code
- **Follow AAA pattern**: Arrange → Act → Assert
- **Mock all hardware dependencies** in unit tests

### Code Quality Standards
- **Maximum 300 lines per file** (exceptions require justification)
- **No code duplication** - refactor shared logic to utils
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `telescope_altitude`, `move_stepper`)
- **PEP 8 compliance** for all Python code

### Change Control
- **Only implement requested changes** - no unsolicited improvements
- **Preserve backward compatibility** unless explicitly requested
- **Document breaking changes** with migration guides

## Critical Constraints

### Raspberry Pi Ecosystem
- System packages (apt) required for: picamera2, libcamera, RPi.GPIO
- numpy version must be <2.0.0 for picamera2 compatibility
- Always test on actual Raspberry Pi hardware, not just mocks

### Error Handling
- All camera operations must have retry logic with exponential backoff
- Mount errors must safely return to home position
- Web routes must return appropriate HTTP status codes with JSON error messages
- Always log full stack traces for debugging

## Project Structure
```
camera/          # Camera implementations and factory
mount/           # Mount control and stepper motor
session/         # Automated capture sessions
web/            # Flask REST API + Socket.IO backend
wanda-telescope/ # Next.js 14 frontend application
utils/          # Shared utilities
tests/          # Test suite (unit, integration, web)
deployment/     # Systemd services and Nginx config
```

## Critical Architecture Notes
- **Backend**: Flask + Socket.IO with selective eventlet monkey patching (prevents deadlocks)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, runs on port 3000 (dev) or via Nginx (production)
- **WebSocket**: 3 namespaces (`/ws/camera`, `/ws/mount`, `/ws/session`)
- **Production**: Unified via Nginx reverse proxy on port 80
- **Services**: wanda-backend.service + wanda-frontend.service auto-start on boot
